I built my own POSIX-compliant shell in just 250 lines of code that is capable of
interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like
cd, pwd, echo and more. 
### Added functionalities for:
-  Navigation
-  Quoting
-  Redirection
-  Autocompletion
-  Piping

### Note: For python implementation see app/main.py
